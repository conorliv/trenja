Trenja - Trending Kanji
===========

This project aims to provide a quick insight into which kanji
are most commonly used by real Japanese people in real time.

Kanji is a big obstacle for people who are trying to learn Japanese.
There are well over 6,000 of these characters that are in use today.
To ease the burden of tackling 6,000 characters, the Japanese government
provides a list of the most frequently used kanji out of those ~6,000.
In 2010, there were 2,136 kanji on this list. While this is much less
intimidating than 6,000, learning 2,136 characters is still a massive
undertaking. Trenja attempts to help people who are trying to learn
kanji by using data mining strategies to determine which kanji are
being used the most by real Japanese people in real time. Knowing this
information can help kanji learners by showing them which kanji, out
of the ~6,000 that are out there, they should study first.

The underlying assumption is that one should study the kanji that are used
most often by real live Japanese people because those are the kanji
one will see the most often.
